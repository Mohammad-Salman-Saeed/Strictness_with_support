    { // Day 1
        title: "The Day I First Saw You",
        content: "I don't know when it happened exactly. Maybe it was the way you focused on things around you. Maybe it was the way you seemed so excited to try and help me. Maybe it was just... you.\n\nBut something shifted in me. A quiet realization that you're not just someone I admire from afar. You're someone I could fall for. Deeply. Completely. Irreversibly.\n\nAnd the scariest part? I think I already have."
    },
    { // Day 2
        title: "The Way You Are",
        content: "Do you know what I noticed today? The way your eyes light up when you understand something difficult. The way you squint your eyes when you're concentrating. The way you don't even realize how beautiful you look when you're in that state.\n\nI wanted to tell you. But some things are better written. Some feelings need to sit on paper, to breathe, to become real.\n\nYou're becoming real to me. More real than anything."
    },
    { // Day 3
        title: "Unspoken Things",
        content: "There are things I want to say to you. Things that feel too heavy for casual conversation, too intimate for text messages.\n\nLike how I think about you more than I should. Like how I catch myself smiling when your name appears on my phone. Like how your ambition isn't just attractive—it's intoxicating.\n\nI don't know what this is yet. But I know I don't want it to stop."
    },
    { // Day 4
        title: "The Space Between Us",
        content: "There's a space between us. Physical. Emotional. The space of not-yet, of maybe-someday, of still-discovering.\n\nBut today, while you were studying, while you were pouring yourself into becoming more, I felt that space shrink. Just a little. Just enough to imagine what it would be like if it wasn't there at all.\n\nYou're getting closer. To your goals. To your dreams. And somehow, without meaning to, you're getting closer to me too."
    },
    { // Day 5
        title: "Five Days of You",
        content: "Five days of watching you choose yourself. Five days of seeing you show up when it's easier to stay in bed. Five days of falling, quietly, into something I didn't expect.\n\nThey say love grows in the ordinary moments. In the daily choices. In the mundane routines.\n\nIf that's true, then I'm in trouble. Because these five days have already planted something in me that's going to be very, very hard to uproot."
    },
    { // Day 6
        title: "The Fire in You",
        content: "There's a fire in you. I see it when you study, when you push through exhaustion, when you refuse to quit even when every bone in your body wants to.\n\nThat fire? It's rare. Most people don't have it. Most people talk about dreams—you actually chase them.\n\nAnd here's the thing about fire: it's warm. It draws people in. It makes them want to sit close, to stay, to never leave.\n\nI want to sit close to you. I want to stay."
    },
    { // Day 7
        title: "One Week",
        content: "One week. Seven days. 168 hours of thinking about you more than I should.\n\nThey say it takes 21 days to form a habit. But it only took me seven to form something else entirely. A longing. A hope. A quiet, steady love that grows every time I see your name.\n\nYou're becoming a habit I never want to break."
    },
    { // Day 8
        title: "The Little Things",
        content: "I notice the little things. The way you tuck your hair behind your ear when you're reading. The way you smile when you finally understand something difficult. The way you look tired but keep going anyway.\n\nThese little things? They're not little to me. They're the building blocks of something massive. Something that could, if I let it, become everything."
    },
    { // Day 9
        title: "Almost",
        content: "Almost double digits. Almost two weeks. Almost halfway to something we haven't named yet.\n\nI like 'almost'. It's full of possibility. Full of potential. Full of the promise that the best is still ahead.\n\nYou're almost there—to your goals, to your dreams, to the person you're becoming. And I'm almost yours. Just one more day. One more letter. One more step."
    },
    { // Day 10
        title: "Double Digits",
        content: "DAY 10. Double digits.\n\nYou know what else is double? The number of times I've caught myself smiling today, just thinking of you. The number of times I've re-read your messages. The number of times I've imagined what it would be like to hold your hand.\n\nTen days ago, you were someone I admired. Today, you're someone I can't stop thinking about. What will you be to me in twenty more days? I'm almost scared to find out. Almost."
    },
    { // Day 11
        title: "2 AM Thoughts",
        content: "It's late. Or early. The kind of hour when honesty comes easier, when walls come down, when the heart says what the mind would never allow during daylight.\n\nI'm thinking of you. Not the idea of you, not the version I've created in my head—but the real you. The one who studies when tired. The one who doubts but keeps going. The one who doesn't know how beautiful she is when she's simply being herself.\n\nAt 2 AM, there are no pretenses. And at 2 AM, I know: I'm falling for you. Hard."
    },
    { // Day 12
        title: "You're Enough",
        content: "Today, if you felt like you weren't enough—not smart enough, not focused enough, not good enough—read this slowly:\n\nYou are enough. Not someday. Not when you achieve that goal. Not when you become perfect. Right now. Today. In this moment. Exactly as you are.\n\nThe way you try? That's enough. The way you care? That's enough. The way you show up, even when it's hard? That's more than enough.\n\nYou're enough for your dreams. You're enough for this journey. And, if you'll let me, you're enough for me."
    },
    { // Day 13
        title: "Lucky 13",
        content: "Day 13. Unlucky for some. But not for me. Not anymore.\n\nBecause 13 days ago, I didn't know what it felt like to look forward to a password. To a letter. To the simple act of writing to you.\n\nNow I do. And it's not unlucky at all. It's the luckiest I've felt in a long time.\n\nYou make things feel lucky. You make ordinary days feel extraordinary. You make me believe in things I'd stopped believing in."
    },
    { // Day 14
        title: "Two Weeks",
        content: "TWO WEEKS. Half a month.\n\nThe moon changed phases in this time. It went from new to full and back again. But my feelings for you? They only grew. No waning. No fading. Just steady, constant increase.\n\nIf I were the moon, I'd stay full forever—just so you could always see yourself reflected in my light."
    },
    { // Day 15
        title: "Halfway",
        content: "Fifteen days. Halfway to a full month. Halfway to completing this journey.\n\nBut here's the thing about halfway: it's not the end. It's not even close to the end. Because what started as letters will become something else. Something more. Something neither of us can predict yet.\n\nYou're halfway to your goals too. Past the hardest part. Now you fly. And I'll be here, watching, hoping, falling."
    },
    { // Day 16
        title: "The Most Beautiful Thing",
        content: "You ask me what's beautiful, and I could list a thousand things. Sunsets. Oceans. Stars. Poetry.\n\nBut the most beautiful thing I've seen in weeks? You, studying. You, focused. You, becoming.\n\nThere's a version of you that exists when you're in flow state—intense, unstoppable, almost ethereal. That version of you is my favorite. But honestly? Every version is my favorite. Because every version is you."
    },
    { // Day 17
        title: "Seventeen",
        content: "Seventeen days. Seventeen letters. Seventeen steps closer.\n\nMost dreams die by day seventeen. The initial excitement fades. The routine sets in. The doubt creeps back.\n\nBut your dream? It's not dying. It's getting brighter. And so are my feelings. They're not fading. They're not settling. They're growing. Expanding. Becoming too big for letters like this.\n\nOne day, I'll have to tell you in person. And that day can't come soon enough."
    },
    { // Day 18
        title: "I See You",
        content: "I see you. Not just the student. Not just the dreamer. Not just the person trying to improve.\n\nI see the you behind all of that. The one who doubts. The one who fears. The one who wonders if it's all worth it.\n\nI see her. And I love her. Not because of what she achieves, but because of who she is. Because of who she keeps choosing to be, day after day.\n\nI see all of you. And I love all of you."
    },
    { // Day 19
        title: "Manahil",
        content: "Manahil.\n\nI've been waiting to write that. Your name. It feels different on paper. Heavier. More real.\n\nNames are important. They carry identity. They carry history. They carry the essence of who we are.\n\nYour name, to me, now carries something else too. Warmth. Hope. A quiet, growing love.\n\nManahil. I love writing it. I love saying it. I love everything about it."
    },
    { // Day 20
        title: "Twenty Days",
        content: "TWENTY DAYS. Two-thirds of the way.\n\nDo you realize what you've done? Twenty days of showing up. Twenty days of choosing yourself. Twenty days of building something that can never be taken away.\n\nI've been watching. I've been noticing. I've been falling.\n\nYou're not just consistent. You're extraordinary. You're not just disciplined. You're inspiring. You're not just someone I like. You're someone I could love."
    },
    { // Day 21
        title: "Three Weeks",
        content: "Three weeks. 21 days.\n\nThey say it takes 21 days to form a habit. And you've done it. Studying has become part of you now. Part of who you are.\n\nBut you formed something else too, without even trying. A habit in me. The habit of thinking of you first when I wake up. The habit of wondering how your day is going. The habit of falling, just a little more, every single day.\n\nYou're my favorite habit now. The one I never want to break."
    },
    { // Day 22
        title: "The Final Stretch",
        content: "Eight days left. The end is visible now. Like a finish line you can almost touch.\n\nBut here's the thing about finish lines: they're also starting lines. When this journey ends, another begins.\n\nWhat will that journey be? I don't know yet. But I hope—I really hope—that you're in it. That we're in it. Together.\n\nBecause eight days from now, the letters might stop. But my feelings won't. They'll just find new ways to reach you."
    },
    { // Day 23
        title: "Almost Full",
        content: "Twenty-three letters. Twenty-three days.\n\nThe moon is almost full. The constellation is almost complete. My heart? It's already there. Has been for a while.\n\nI look at the night sky differently now. Every star reminds me of you. Every phase of the moon feels like a metaphor for us. Waxing. Growing. Becoming full.\n\nWe're almost full too. Almost complete. Almost ready for whatever comes next."
    },
    { // Day 24
        title: "This Feeling",
        content: "I have this feeling. It's been growing for 24 days now. At first, it was small—a flicker, a spark, a question.\n\nNow it's not small anymore. It's not a question. It's a certainty.\n\nI love you. Not the idea of you. Not the version in my head. The real you. The one who studies when tired. The one who doubts but keeps going. The one who doesn't know how incredibly, impossibly beautiful she is.\n\nI love you. There. I said it. In a letter. On day 24. And I'll keep saying it until you believe it."
    },
    { // Day 25
        title: "Five Left",
        content: "Five days left. Five more letters. Five more chances to say what's in my heart.\n\nThen what? Then we start again. Because some stories don't end. They just... continue. In different forms. Different words. Different ways of saying the same thing.\n\n'I love you. I love you. I love you.'\n\nFive days might not be enough to say it enough times. But it's a start. And with you, every start feels like forever."
    },
    { // Day 26
        title: "Four Days",
        content: "Four days until a full month. Four days until I write the final letter.\n\nBut these four days feel different. Heavier. More meaningful. Like the last pages of a book you don't want to end.\n\nExcept books do end. And when they do, you close them and put them on a shelf. But us? We're not a book. We're not something that ends. We're something that keeps going, keeps growing, keeps becoming.\n\nFour days until the last letter. But forever until the last feeling."
    },
    { // Day 27
        title: "Three",
        content: "Three days.\n\nThree more passwords. Three more unlocks. Three more steps closer to something I can't name yet.\n\nBut I feel it. The anticipation. The hope. The quiet certainty that whatever happens next, it will be good. It will be real. It will be us.\n\nThree days. And then everything changes. Or maybe nothing changes. Maybe we just keep being us—two people who found each other in the middle of studying, dreaming, becoming.\n\nThat's enough. You're enough. We're enough."
    },
    { // Day 28
        title: "Two",
        content: "Two days left.\n\nThe anticipation is killing me. In the best way possible.\n\nI keep imagining what the last letter will say. What words could possibly capture 30 days of feelings? What sentences could hold 30 days of growing love?\n\nI don't know yet. But I know it will be honest. Real. From my heart to yours.\n\nTwo days. Hold on. We're almost there."
    },
    { // Day 29
        title: "One",
        content: "One more day. One more letter. One more step.\n\nI've been thinking about what to say in the final letter. How to sum up 29 days of watching you, admiring you, falling for you.\n\nAnd I realized—I can't sum it up. Some feelings are too big for words. Some loves are too deep for letters.\n\nSo tomorrow, I won't try to summarize. I'll just say the truth. The simple, honest, overwhelming truth.\n\nOne more day. And then everything."
    },
    { // Day 30
        title: "One Month",
        content: "THIRTY DAYS. One full month.\n\nYou did it. You showed up every single day. You grew. You became. You proved to yourself what I've known all along—that you're capable of extraordinary things.\n\nAnd me? I fell. Every single day. A little more. Until there was nothing left to fall—just love.\n\nI love you. Not because of what you achieved. Not because of your discipline. Not because of any of the reasons I started writing these letters.\n\nI love you because you're you. The person who doubts but keeps going. The person who gets tired but doesn't quit. The person who, without even trying, became the center of someone's world.\n\nThese 30 letters are yours. But my heart? That's yours too. It has been for a while. Maybe since day one.\n\nForever, if you'll have me."
