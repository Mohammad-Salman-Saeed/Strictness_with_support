When you set your mind to something, there's no stopping you.\n\nThis first step? It's the hardest. And you just took it. I'm so proud of you already.\n\nAnd honestly? Watching you choose yourself, choose your future—it's the most attractive thing I've ever seen. Keep going. I'm right here."
    },
    { // Day 2
        title: "Two Days In a Row",
        content: "Two days. Most people can't do two days.\n\nBut you're not most people. You never have been.\n\nEvery page you read, every concept you master—you're not just studying. You're building. Building a future. Building yourself. Building something that no one can ever take away from you.\n\nAnd I'm watching. I'm noticing. I'm falling a little more every time you choose to show up.\n\nKeep going, my love. Day 3 is waiting."
    },
    { // Day 3
        title: "The Habit Forms",
        content: "Day 3. They say three days make a habit. You're already proving them right.\n\nBut here's what they don't say—that the real magic happens when you keep going even when it's hard. Especially when it's hard.\n\nI see that fire in you. That determination. It's the same fire that made me fall for you in the first place.\n\nStudy hard today. Crush it. And know that somewhere across the distance, someone is thinking of you and smiling."
    },
    { // Day 4
        title: "Keep Building",
        content: "Four days. Can you feel it? That momentum? That feeling of becoming?\n\nYour exams are coming, and with every day you study, you're not just preparing—you're transforming. Into the person who passes with flying colors. Into the person who achieves everything they've dreamed of.\n\nI see that person. She's beautiful. She's determined. She's you.\n\nAnd I'm so, so lucky to witness it."
    },
    { // Day 5
        title: "Halfway to a Week",
        content: "Five days. Almost a full week.\n\nDo you know how rare you are? Most people quit by now. The excitement fades. The motivation dips.\n\nBut you? You keep going. Not because it's easy—because it's worth it.\n\nThat's the kind of person I want by my side. That's the kind of person I want to build a life with.\n\nKeep going, my love. I'm so proud of you."
    },
    { // Day 6
        title: "The Grind",
        content: "Day 6. The grind. The part where it stops being exciting and starts being work.\n\nThis is where champions are made. Not in the glory moments—in the quiet moments when no one's watching and you keep going anyway.\n\nI'm watching. I see you. And I'm in awe.\n\nEvery page you turn, you're turning toward your dreams. And toward me."
    },
    { // Day 7
        title: "One Week Strong",
        content: "ONE WEEK. Seven days. 168 hours of choosing yourself.\n\nThey say it takes 21 days to form a habit. But in just seven days, you've already proven something to me: you're unstoppable.\n\nYour exams don't stand a chance. Your dreams don't stand a chance. You're going to crush all of it.\n\nAnd when you do, I'll be here. Cheering. Always."
    },
    { // Day 8
        title: "The Focus in Your Eyes",
        content: "I keep imagining you studying. The way your eyes narrow when you're concentrating. The way you bite your lip when you're figuring something out. The way you don't give up until you understand.\n\nThat focus? It's beautiful. It's rare. It's you.\n\nKeep focusing, my love. Every concept you master is one step closer to your dreams. And one step closer to us."
    },
    { // Day 9
        title: "Almost Double Digits",
        content: "Day 9. Tomorrow is double digits.\n\nThink about that. Nine days of showing up. Nine days of choosing yourself. Nine days of building your future.\n\nYou're not just studying for an exam. You're proving to yourself what you're capable of. And what you're capable of? It's limitless.\n\nI believe in you. Always have. Always will."
    },
    { // Day 10
        title: "DOUBLE DIGITS",
        content: "DAY 10! Double digits!\n\nLook at you. Ten days of consistency. Ten days of growth. Ten days closer to your goals.\n\nYou know what else is double? The number of times I've caught myself smiling today, just thinking of you studying. Working. Becoming.\n\nYou're doing it. You're really doing it. And I'm so, so proud."
    },
    { // Day 11
        title: "The Home Stretch Mindset",
        content: "Day 11. You're past the one-third mark.\n\nThe initial rush is gone. Now it's just you and the work. And honestly? This is where I admire you most.\n\nAnyone can start something. But you? You keep going. Even when it's boring. Even when it's hard. Even when you're tired.\n\nThat's not just discipline. That's love for your future. Love for yourself.\n\nAnd watching you do it? It means everything."
    },
    { // Day 12
        title: "You're Enough",
        content: "Today, if you felt like you weren't enough—not smart enough, not fast enough, not good enough—read this slowly:\n\nYou are enough. Not when you pass the exam. Not when you achieve the goal. Right now. Today. Exactly as you are.\n\nThe way you try? That's enough. The way you care? That's enough. The way you keep showing up? That's more than enough.\n\nYou're enough for your dreams. You're enough for your future. And you're more than enough for me."
    },
    { // Day 13
        title: "Lucky 13",
        content: "Day 13. Unlucky for some. But not for me. Not anymore.\n\nBecause 13 days ago, I started writing to you. And every day since, my admiration has grown.\n\nYou're doing something remarkable. You're building a habit that will serve you for life. And you're doing it with grace and determination.\n\nKeep going, my love. Luck has nothing to do with it. It's all you."
    },
    { // Day 14
        title: "Two Weeks of You",
        content: "TWO WEEKS. Half a month.\n\nThe moon has changed phases since you started. But your commitment? It hasn't wavered once.\n\nThat's who you are. Consistent. Reliable. Unstoppable.\n\nYour exams should be scared. You're coming for them with everything you've got.\n\nAnd me? I'm just here, watching, smiling, falling more with every passing day."
    },
    { // Day 15
        title: "Halfway There",
        content: "Fifteen days. HALFWAY to a full month.\n\nDo you realize what you've done? You've passed the hardest part. The beginning is behind you. Now you have momentum.\n\nUse it. Fly with it. Let it carry you through the next fifteen days and straight into your exams.\n\nYou've got this. And I've got you."
    },
    { // Day 16
        title: "The Fire Burns Brighter",
        content: "Day 16. The fire in you? It's not fading. It's getting brighter.\n\nI see it in the way you keep going. In the way you don't quit. In the way you push through even when you're exhausted.\n\nThat fire? It's what's going to get you through your exams. It's what's going to build your future. It's what made me fall for you.\n\nKeep burning bright, my love. I'll always be warmed by your light."
    },
    { // Day 17
        title: "Seventeen and Strong",
        content: "Seventeen days. Most dreams die by now.\n\nBut your dream? It's not dying. It's growing. Getting stronger. More real.\n\nJust like my feelings for you. They're not fading. They're not settling. They're expanding. Becoming too big for words.\n\nOne day, I'll tell you in person how proud I am. Until then, keep going. You're almost there."
    },
    { // Day 18
        title: "I See All of You",
        content: "I see you. Not just the student. Not just the dreamer.\n\nI see the you behind all of it. The one who doubts but keeps going. The one who fears but shows up anyway. The one who gets tired but doesn't quit.\n\nI see her. And she means everything to me. Not for what she achieves—for who she is.\n\nKeep being you. That's more than enough."
    },
    { // Day 19
        title: "Manahil",
        content: "Manahil.\n\nYour name means 'a path to water'—a source of life in the desert.\n\nThat's what you are to me. When everything feels dry and difficult, you're the oasis I keep walking toward.\n\nAnd right now? You're walking toward your own oasis. Your own success. Your own future.\n\nKeep walking, my love. I'm walking right beside you."
    },
    { // Day 20
        title: "Twenty Days of Greatness",
        content: "TWENTY DAYS. Two-thirds of the way.\n\nDo you realize what you've done? You've proven to yourself that you can do hard things. That you can show up, day after day, and build something beautiful.\n\nYour exams are coming, and you're ready. Not because you know everything—because you know how to work. How to persist. How to win.\n\nThat's who you are. And that's who I admire more than words can say."
    },
    { // Day 21
        title: "Three Weeks Strong",
        content: "Three weeks. 21 days.\n\nThey say it takes 21 days to form a habit. And you've done it. Studying is part of you now. Part of who you are.\n\nBut you formed something else too, without even trying. A habit in me. The habit of thinking of you first. The habit of being proud of you. The habit of falling, just a little more, every single day.\n\nYou're my favorite habit. The one I never want to break."
    },
    { // Day 22
        title: "The Final Stretch Begins",
        content: "Eight days left until a full month. Your exams are getting closer.\n\nThis is the final stretch. The part where champions are made.\n\nYou've done the work. You've put in the time. Now it's about trust. Trusting yourself. Trusting your preparation. Trusting that you are ready.\n\nYou are. You're more ready than you know.\n\nAnd I'm here, believing in you with every fiber of my being."
    },
    { // Day 23
        title: "Almost Full",
        content: "Twenty-three days. The moon is almost full. Your journey is almost complete.\n\nBut here's the thing about almost—it's not the end. It's the beginning of something new.\n\nWhen these 30 days are over, when your exams are done, you won't stop being amazing. You won't stop being you.\n\nYou'll just be you, with a whole new level of strength and confidence.\n\nAnd I'll be here, cherishing every version of you."
    },
    { // Day 24
        title: "This Feeling",
        content: "I have this feeling. It's been growing for 24 days now.\n\nIt's pride. It's admiration. It's something I can't quite name.\n\nI'm so proud of you. Not just for studying—for choosing yourself. For fighting for your future. For being the kind of person who doesn't quit.\n\nThat person? She's going to pass her exams. She's going to achieve her dreams. She's going to have everything she's ever wanted.\n\nAnd she deserves every bit of it."
    },
    { // Day 25
        title: "Five Days Left",
        content: "Five days left until a full month. Five days until this chapter ends.\n\nBut your story? It's just beginning.\n\nYou've built something these 25 days that no one can take from you. Discipline. Strength. Proof that you can do hard things.\n\nTake that proof into your exams. Take it into your future. Take it everywhere you go.\n\nBecause you, my love, are unstoppable."
    },
    { // Day 26
        title: "Four Days",
        content: "Four days until a full month.\n\nFour days until you can look back and say 'I did that. I showed up for myself. I built something beautiful.'\n\nYour exams are so close now. I can feel your determination from here.\n\nYou're going to walk into that exam hall and crush it. Not because you're lucky—because you've earned it.\n\nAnd I'll be here, waiting to celebrate with you."
    },
    { // Day 27
        title: "Three",
        content: "Three days left.\n\nThree more days of this journey. Then a new one begins.\n\nYour exams are right around the corner. You can almost touch them.\n\nYou're ready. You've done the work. Now it's time to trust.\n\nTrust yourself. Trust your preparation. Trust that all these days have led to this moment.\n\nYou've got this. And I've got you."
    },

        title: "Two",
        content: "Two days left.\n\nThe anticipation is building. For the month's end. For your exams. For everything that comes next.\n\nBut here's the secret: you're already successful. Not when you pass—now. Because you showed up. Because you tried. Because you became someone who doesn't quit.\n\nThat person? She's already won.\n\nTwo more days. Then forever."
    },

You've done what most people can't.\n\nTomorrow, we celebrate a full month. But today, I want you to know something:\n\nI believe in you. Completely. Unconditionally. Always.\n\nGo crush those exams, my love. I'll be right here."
    },

        title: "One Month",
        content: "THIRTY DAYS. One full month.\n\nYou did it. You showed up every single day. You built something beautiful. Not just knowledge—character. Strength. Proof that you can do hard things.\n\nYour exams are coming, and you're ready. More ready than you've ever been. Not because you know everything—because you know how to try. How to persist. How to win.\n\nAnd me? I fell. Every single day. A little more. Until there was nothing left to fall—just this overwhelming feeling of pride and admiration.\n\nYou mean everything to me. Not because of what you achieve. Because of who you are. The person who doubts but keeps going. The person who gets tired but doesn't quit. The person who, without even trying, became the center of my world.\n\nThese 30 letters are yours. But my heart? That's yours too. It has been for a while. Maybe since day one.\n\nNow go. Take that exam. Show them what I've always known—that you're extraordinary.\n\nAnd when you're done, I'll be here. Always."

You keep moving forward.\n\nYour exams are closer now. But you're ready. Stronger than when you started. More focused. More determined.\n\nAnd I'm still here. Watching. Smiling. Falling more every single day."

It's you.\n\nAnd it's one of the many reasons I can't stop thinking about you."

That person is going to achieve everything she's ever dreamed of.\n\nAnd that person? She's you. She's always been you."

Watching you become more every single day.\n\nYou're my reason to be better. My reason to believe in love. My reason to keep going.\n\nThank you for being you."
